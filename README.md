My go at the 10958 problem from the [*Crazy Sequential Representation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1479) publication by Inder J. Taneja. See the corresponding [Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ruC5A9EzzE) for more explanation.

# The problem

Represent the number 10958 in an equation using the operations `+ - * / ^` using all digits from 1 to 9 in sequential order.
